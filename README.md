Final Project
Is the Myers-Briggs Personality test valid? The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is
an introspective self-report questionnaire designed to help individuals understand how they
communicate within and outside themselves and make decisions based on that (“The Myers &
Briggs Foundation”). The MBTI has been widely used around the world in countless different
fields, most commonly in the business world. They usually use the results to get a sense of an
individual’s personality, but the validity and reliability of the test have been greatly questioned
by scientists for a while now (Burnett, 2013). The official Myers-Briggs website declared that
they’re still the most trusted and best-known personality test out there but there have been
debates over the truth behind that (“Myers-Briggs Type Indicator”). The main complaint people
have over the MBTI is that the human personality is very complex and can’t be described and is
limited by only 16 different personality types. It also relies exclusively on binary choices,
meaning there is no middle ground for the choices people make during the self-report
questionnaire. Despite all of the criticisms, the MBTI as an industry makes around $20 million a
year (Burnett, 2013). To check the validity, there’s a need to test it first-hand using the tools
provided by computational methods. Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, will be used as a
method. This method is:
“...the use of natural language processing to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and
study affective states and subjective information” (Parker, 2022).
The objective of this research is to determine whether the MBTI is a valid tool to be used in
professional settings or just for fun by analyzing the data.
